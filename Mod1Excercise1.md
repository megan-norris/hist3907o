Something I hope to achieve out of the course is being able to process things from a different perspective. I hope to gain a different type of appreciation for the way we fabricate history in our every day. It's already common knowledge that libraries are a dying breed, so we must look to alternatives to be able to gain a wealth of knowledge. Clearly (and inevitably) this was the Internet. In this day and age you can pull out a device that fits in your hand and be able to look up anything, anywhere, in any language. You couldn't do that fifty years ago. We used to need to heavily rely on books, now we don't. It's still an unfortunate requirement in the classroom, you can't exactly get very far without purchasing a book that costs 150$ (except for this course, how lovely).

Not only do we rely on the Internet to fuel our knowledge, but we look to our peers, our mentors, and our environment to tell us what we're interested in, and how we should gain that knowledge. Digital History ends up being a foundation for how the modern age has developed. You can go from not knowing a single thing about a subject, to (if you're diligent enough) being an expert in no time flat and generally at no-fee, by just being able to use Google. For all intents and purposes, this is not exactly ideal for educational institutions who thrive at students being present and able in courses. We've entered a new age where being relient on location information seems to be more ideal than present in a classroom. For instance, my spouse goes from not knowing anything about a CNC machine and having no formal training - to being able to operate and fabricate new products out of aluminum without us needing to purchase them on EBay or having them imported - in a span of a couple of months. Formal training for something of that magnitude takes people a minimum of two years on campus at Algonquin in Ottawa. However, my spouse saved the 8000$ in tuition fees, and now knows whether he likes CNC machining or not (and we saved the cost on some car parts).

Digital History is imperative and essential to how we progress as human beings in this day and age. Every day there is something new and important to be distributed, and we no longer rely on using paper and pen to sell it. Technology is advancing at such a rapid pace, 95% of the time we can't keep up with it. We are a generation built on technology, we need to continue to grow with it, or drown in it. My brother who is seven years younger than me has a broader knowledge of technology than I do, just because he grew up to learn it from a different era - and now I have to catch up with it (which is much harder to do as you age).
